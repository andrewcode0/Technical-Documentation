  <p>HTTP is an extensible protocol that relies on concepts like resources and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), simple message structure, and client-server communication flow. On top of these basic concepts, numerous extensions have been developed over the years that add updated functionality and semantics with new HTTP methods or headers.</p>
  <p>Overview of HTTP
Describes what HTTP is and its role in web architecture, including its position in the protocol stack.</p>
  <p>Resources and URIs
A brief introduction to the concept of resources, identifiers, and locations on the web.</p>
  <p>Identifying resources on the Web
Describes how web resources are referenced and how to locate them.</p>
  <p>Data URLs
A specific kind of URI that directly embeds the resource it represents. Data URLs are very convenient, but have some caveats.</p>
   <p>Resource URLs Non-Standard
Resource URLs, those prefixed with the resource scheme are used by Firefox and Firefox browser extensions to load resources internally, but is also available to some sites the browser connects to as well.</p>

  <p>Flow of an HTTP session
This article describes a typical HTTP session; i.e. what happens when you follow a link or load an image into a web page.</p>
  <p>HTTP Messages
HTTP Messages transmitted during requests or responses have a very clear structure. This introductory article describes this structure, its purpose, and its possibilities.</p>

     <p>HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.</p>
  <p>A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.</p>
  <p>Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.</p>
  <p>Designed in the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time.</p>
  <p>It is an application layer protocol that is sent over TCP, or over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection, though any reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used. Due to its extensibility, it is used to not only fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with HTML form results. HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.</p>
   <p>Components of HTTP-based systems
HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example, a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.</p>
  <p>Each individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer called the response. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called proxies, which perform different operations and act as gateways or caches, for example.

</p>
  <p>In reality, there are more computers between a browser and the server handling the request: there are routers, modems, and more. Thanks to the layered design of the Web, these are hidden in the network and transport layers. HTTP is on top, at the application layer. Although important for diagnosing network problems, the underlying layers are mostly irrelevant to the description of HTTP.</p>
  <p>The user-agent is any tool that acts on behalf of the user. This role is primarily performed by the Web browser, but it may also be performed by programs used by engineers and Web developers to debug their applications.</p>
  <p>The browser is always the entity initiating the request. It is never the server (though some mechanisms have been added over the years to simulate server-initiated messages).</p>

     <p>Evolution of HTTP
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991, HTTP has gone through many changes that have helped maintain its simplicity while shaping its flexibility. Keep reading to learn how HTTP evolved from a protocol designed to exchange files in a semitrusted laboratory environment into a modern internet maze that carries images and videos in high resolution and 3D.</p>
  <p>In 1989, while working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal to build a hypertext system over the internet. Initially called the Mesh, it was later renamed the World Wide Web during its implementation in 1990. Built over the existing TCP and IP protocols, it consisted of 4 building blocks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A textual format to represent hypertext documents, the HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
<li>A simple protocol to exchange these documents, the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</li>
<li>A client to display (and edit) these documents, the first web browser called the WorldWideWeb.</li>
<li>A server to give access to the document, an early version of httpd.</li>
 <li> <p>These four building blocks were completed by the end of 1990, and the first servers were running outside of CERN by early 1991. On August 6, 1991, Tim Berners-Lee posted on the public alt.hypertext newsgroup. This is now considered to be the official start of the World Wide Web as a public project.</p></li></ul>
  <p>The HTTP protocol used in those early phases was very simple. It was later dubbed HTTP/0.9 and is sometimes called the one-line protocol.</p>
  <p>The initial version of HTTP had no version number; it was later called 0.9 to differentiate it from later versions. HTTP/0.9 was extremely simple: requests consisted of a single line and started with the only possible method GET followed by the path to the resource. The full URL wasn't included as the protocol, server, and port weren't necessary once connected to the server.</p>
  <code>GET /mypage.html</code>
   <p>The response was extremely simple, too: it only consisted of the file itself.</p>
   <code><html>
A very simple HTML page
</html></code>
  <p>Unlike subsequent evolutions, there were no HTTP headers. This meant that only HTML files could be transmitted. There were no status or error codes. If there was a problem, a specific HTML file was generated and included a description of the problem for human consumption.</p>
  <p>HTTP/0.9 was very limited, but browsers and servers quickly made it more versatile:

Versioning information was sent within each request (HTTP/1.0 was appended to the GET line).
A status code line was also sent at the beginning of a response. This allowed the browser itself to recognize the success or failure of a request and adapt its behavior accordingly. For example,</p>
  <p>Between 1991-1995, these were introduced with a try-and-see approach. A server and a browser would add a feature and see if it got traction. Interoperability problems were common. In an effort to solve these issues, an informational document that described the common practices was published in November 1996. This was known as RFC 1945 and defined HTTP/1.0.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, proper standardization was in progress. This happened in parallel to the diverse implementations of HTTP/1.0. The first standardized version of HTTP, HTTP/1.1, was published in early 1997, only a few months after HTTP/1.0.</p>

     <p>HTTP messages are how data is exchanged between a server and a client. There are two types of messages: requests sent by the client to trigger an action on the server, and responses, the answer from the server.</p>
  <p>HTTP messages are composed of textual information encoded in ASCII, and span over multiple lines. In HTTP/1.1, and earlier versions of the protocol, these messages were openly sent across the connection. In HTTP/2, the once human-readable message is now divided up into HTTP frames, providing optimization and performance improvements.</p>
  <p>Web developers, or webmasters, rarely craft these textual HTTP messages themselves: software, a Web browser, proxy, or Web server, perform this action. They provide HTTP messages through config files (for proxies or servers), APIs (for browsers), or other interfaces.</p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages/httpmsg2.png"/>
  <p>The HTTP/2 binary framing mechanism has been designed to not require any alteration of the APIs or config files applied: it is broadly transparent to the user.</p>
   <ol><li><p>A start-line describing the requests to be implemented, or its status of whether successful or a failure. This start-line is always a single line.</p></li>
  <li><p>An optional set of HTTP headers specifying the request, or describing the body included in the message.</p></li>
  <li><p>A blank line indicating all meta-information for the request has been sent.</p></li>
  <li><p>An optional body containing data associated with the request (like content of an HTML form), or the document associated with a response. The presence of the body and its size is specified by the start-line and HTTP headers.</p></li></ol>
  <p>The start-line and HTTP headers of the HTTP message are collectively known as the head of the requests, whereas its payload is known as the body.</p>
  <p>This is how HTTPS messages work.</p>

     <p>In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consist of three phases:</p>
  <ol><li><p>The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP).</p></li>
  <li><p>The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.</p></li>
  <li><p>The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.</p></li></ol>
  <p>As of HTTP/1.1, the connection is no longer closed after completing the third phase, and the client is now granted a further request: this means the second and third phases can now be performed any number of times.</p>
   <p>In client-server protocols, it is the client which establishes the connection. Opening a connection in HTTP means initiating a connection in the underlying transport layer, usually this is TCP.</p>
  <p>With TCP the default port, for an HTTP server on a computer, is port 80. Other ports can also be used, like 8000 or 8080. The URL of a page to fetch contains both the domain name, and the port number, though the latter can be omitted if it is 80. See Identifying resources on the Web for more details.</p>
  <p>Once the connection is established, the user-agent can send the request (a user-agent is typically a web browser, but can be anything else, a crawler, for example).</p>
  <p>Fetching the root page of developer.mozilla.org, (https://developer.mozilla.org/), and telling the server that the user-agent would prefer the page in French, if possible:</p>
  <p><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
Accept-Language: fr;</code></p>
